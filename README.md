This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19A-43J9h0jFOTtZudkziO21P46Cy0WohQlmliurOH5M/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I used AI on this project.


Science Fair Reflection

1. Share one technical concept that you developed greater mastery over in this project. Demonstrate how you understand that concept by sharing your mental model of the concept. Then, show how you used that concept in your project.

One technical concept I got a lot better at in this project was CSS layout and positioning. I used to think CSS was mostly about colors and fonts, but I learned how important it is to control how elements sit on the page and interact with each other. I now understand how things like flex, order, and spacing work to make a section look balanced. For example, in my About Me section, I used flex to position my profile picture and my text next to each other. The picture stays the same size and the text fits nicely beside it, and the skills are aligned under the picture in a way that looks clean and organized. I also used grid for my project cards so they line up evenly and stay centered on the page.

2. Choose one project requirement that you found challenging and are proud of implementing. Describe what made it challenging and how you were able to implement the requirement by walking through your code as succinctly as possible. Remember that your audience does not know your code nearly as well as you do so you’ll have to break it down in a logical manner for them to quickly understand it.

The part I found the most challenging and ended up being proud of was making the project section display my cards evenly and look good on different screen sizes. At first, the cards were uneven, some looked squished, and the hover effects sometimes made them jump. I had to adjust the grid-template-columns, spacing, padding, and card height until everything looked balanced. I also made sure the hover effects were smooth by using transitions and transforms, so when someone hovers over a card it lifts slightly and glows, without breaking the layout. It was tricky because I had to constantly check how it looked on bigger and smaller screens, and tweak the CSS so nothing overlapped or looked awkward.

3. How did you leverage AI to assist your development of this project?

I used AI to help me understand and solve problems faster. I asked it to explain CSS positioning, flex, and grid in simple terms, and also to give suggestions for hover effects and styling my dark/neon theme. Whenever I ran into layout issues, AI gave me examples I could test and adjust. Even though AI helped me figure things out, I made sure I understood every line of code and changed it so it worked exactly how I wanted.
